<h2>Features</h2>
<h3>Generic Event System</h3>
<p>The generic event system allows for decoupled communication between different components in the game. This allows for easy addition of new features and components without having to modify existing code.</p>
<h3>Behaviour Trees System for AI Units</h3>
<p>The behaviour trees system allows for the creation of complex AI behaviour for enemy units. This allows for more intelligent and challenging opponents for the player to face.</p>
<h3>In Game Resource Management System</h3>
<p>The resource management system allows the player to collect resources such as wood, gold, and stone, which are used to build structures and units.</p>

<h3>Minimap</h3>
<p>The minimap provides a top-down view of the game world, allowing the player to easily navigate and keep track of units.</p>
<h3>Fog of War</h3>
<p>The fog of war system obscures the player's view of the map until units are sent to explore. This adds an extra layer of strategy to the gameplay experience.</p>
<h3>Sound System</h3>
<p>The sound system provides immersive audio feedback for various events in the game, such as unit movement and combat.</p>
<h3>Day and Night Cycle</h3>
<p>The day and night cycle adds an extra layer of immersion to the gameplay experience. During the night, visibility is reduced and certain units may have advantages or disadvantages.</p>
<h3>Generic Console for Commands</h3>
<p>The generic console allows the player to input various commands, such as cheat codes or debug commands.</p>
<h3>Generic Data Save Load System</h3>
<p>The generic data save/load system allows the player to save and load their progress in the game.</p>
<h3>Scriptable Object Based Configurations</h3>

<h3>Level Up and Player Loop Progression via Animation Curves</h3>
<p>The level up and player loop progression system allows the player to gain experience and level up, unlocking new abilities and units. The progression is controlled by animation curves, allowing for easy tweaking and balancing.</p>
<h3>Context Aware Building Placement</h3>
<p>The context aware building placement system allows for easy and intuitive placement of structures, taking into account terrain and other obstacles.</p>
<h3>Unit Squad Formation System</h3>
<p>The unit squad formation system allows the player to easily command groups of units, such as assigning them to specific formations or movement patterns.</p>
